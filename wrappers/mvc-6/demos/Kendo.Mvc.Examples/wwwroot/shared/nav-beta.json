Thus the chart fetches the data and displays its series and categoryAxis values by setting their field properties to match the relevant data items attribute names in the source.</p> <br/> <p> To instantiate a Kendo UI chart, you need to specify an empty div with an id on the page, select this div with a jQuery selector and invoke the kendoChart() function.

In this way you can easily make attribute values for widgets observable and modify them automatically when changes are applied in the data source, or alter the underlying data when the user interacts with the UI.</p> <p>In this example we show how to configure the Kendo UI chart to make use of the MVVM functionality exposed by the framework. For this purpose we create a <strong>viewmodel</strong> instance (with <strong>kendo.observable</strong> call) which wraps the chart data source, and instantiate the chart, its attributes and binding definition using <strong>data-</strong> attributes. The important detail to wire the viewmodel is to invoke <strong>kendo.bind</strong> to the container element of the chart, passing the viewmodel as a second argument.

For this purpose we create a <strong>viewmodel</strong> instance (with <strong>kendo.observable</strong> call) which wraps the treemap data source, and instantiate the widget, its attributes and binding definition using <strong>data-</strong> attributes. The important detail to wire the viewmodel is to invoke <strong>kendo.bind</strong> to the container element of the treemap, passing the viewmodel as a second argument. Review the code snippets from the demo for more info.</p> <p>Details on the MVVM features of the Kendo UI framework can be obtained from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/framework/mvvm/overview\">this chapter</a> of the documentation.</p>"
